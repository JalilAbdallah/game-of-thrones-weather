# Game of Thrones Weather Forecast 🌡️⚔️

Welcome to the **Game of Thrones Weather Forecast**, a whimsical app that maps real-world temperatures to regions in the _Game of Thrones_ universe! Whether it's as cold as The Wall or as scorching as Dorne, this app brings the Seven Kingdoms to your local weather report.

## Overview

This project transforms a simple weather forecast into an immersive _Game of Thrones_ experience. The app fetches your local temperature using the WeatherStack API and maps it to a region in Westeros or Essos, complete with thematic descriptions and stunning visuals. For example, a chilly -1°C might feel like Winterfell, while a sweltering 38°C could be Dorne.

## Features

- **Temperature-to-Region Mapping**: Maps temperatures in Celsius to _Game of Thrones_ regions (e.g., -30°C to -10°C → The Wall, 35°C to 40°C → Dorne).
- **Thematic Descriptions**: Each region comes with a flavorful description (e.g., "The Greyjoys are ready to reave" for the Iron Islands).
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Visuals change based on the region (e.g., a snowy Winterfell scene for cold temperatures).
- **WeatherStack API Integration**: Fetches real-time temperature data based on the user’s location.
